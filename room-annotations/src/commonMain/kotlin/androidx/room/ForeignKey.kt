/**
 * Declares a foreign key on another [Entity].
 *
 *
 * Foreign keys allows you to specify constraints across Entities such that SQLite will ensure that
 * the relationship is valid when you modify the database.
 *
 *
 * When a foreign key constraint is specified, SQLite requires the referenced columns to be part of
 * a unique index in the parent table or the primary key of that table. You must create a unique
 * index in the parent entity that covers the referenced columns (Room will verify this at compile
 * time and print an error if it is missing).
 *
 *
 * It is also recommended to create an index on the child table to avoid full table scans when the
 * parent table is modified. If a suitable index on the child table is missing, Room will print
 * [RoomWarnings.MISSING_INDEX_ON_FOREIGN_KEY_CHILD] warning.
 *
 *
 * A foreign key constraint can be deferred until the transaction is complete. This is useful if
 * you are doing bulk inserts into the database in a single transaction. By default, foreign key
 * constraints are immediate but you can change this value by setting [.deferred] to
 * `true`. You can also use
 * [defer_foreign_keys](https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_defer_foreign_keys) PRAGMA
 * to defer them depending on your transaction.
 *
 *
 * Please refer to the SQLite [foreign keys](https://sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html)
 * documentation for details.
