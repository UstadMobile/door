/**
 * Marks a class as a RoomDatabase.
 *
 *
 * The class should be an abstract class and extend
 * [RoomDatabase][androidx.room.RoomDatabase].
 *
 *
 * You can receive an implementation of the class via
 * [Room.databaseBuilder][androidx.room.Room.databaseBuilder] or
 * [Room.inMemoryDatabaseBuilder][androidx.room.Room.inMemoryDatabaseBuilder].
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 * // User and Book are classes annotated with @Entity.
 * @Database(version = 1, entities = {User.class, Book.class})
 * abstract class AppDatabase extends RoomDatabase {
 * // BookDao is a class annotated with @Dao.
 * abstract public BookDao bookDao();
 * // UserDao is a class annotated with @Dao.
 * abstract public UserDao userDao();
 * // UserBookDao is a class annotated with @Dao.
 * abstract public UserBookDao userBookDao();
 * }
</pre> *
 * The example above defines a class that has 2 tables and 3 DAO classes that are used to access it.
 * There is no limit on the number of [Entity] or [Dao] classes but they must be unique
 * within the Database.
 *
 *
 * Instead of running queries on the database directly, you are highly recommended to create
 * [Dao] classes. Using Dao classes will allow you to abstract the database communication in
 * a more logical layer which will be much easier to mock in tests (compared to running direct
 * sql queries). It also automatically does the conversion from `Cursor` to your application
 * classes so you don't need to deal with lower level database APIs for most of your data access.
 *
 *
 * Room also verifies all of your queries in [Dao] classes while the application is being
 * compiled so that if there is a problem in one of the queries, you will be notified instantly.
 * @see Dao
 *
 * @see Entity
 *
 * @see androidx.room.RoomDatabase RoomDatabase
