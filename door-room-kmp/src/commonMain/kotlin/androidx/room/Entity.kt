/**
 * Marks a class as an entity. This class will have a mapping SQLite table in the database.
 *
 *
 * Each entity must have at least 1 field annotated with [PrimaryKey].
 * You can also use [.primaryKeys] attribute to define the primary key.
 *
 *
 * Each entity must either have a no-arg constructor or a constructor whose parameters match
 * fields (based on type and name). Constructor does not have to receive all fields as parameters
 * but if a field is not passed into the constructor, it should either be public or have a public
 * setter. If a matching constructor is available, Room will always use it. If you don't want it
 * to use a constructor, you can annotate it with [Ignore].
 *
 *
 * When a class is marked as an Entity, all of its fields are persisted. If you would like to
 * exclude some of its fields, you can mark them with [Ignore].
 *
 *
 * If a field is `transient`, it is automatically ignored **unless** it is annotated with
 * [ColumnInfo], [Embedded] or [Relation].
 *
 *
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * @Entity
 * public class User {
 * @PrimaryKey
 * private final int uid;
 * private String name;
 * @ColumnInfo(name = "last_name")
 * private String lastName;
 *
 * public User(int uid) {
 * this.uid = uid;
 * }
 * public String getLastName() {
 * return lastName;
 * }
 * public void setLastName(String lastName) {
 * this.lastName = lastName;
 * }
 * }
</pre> *
